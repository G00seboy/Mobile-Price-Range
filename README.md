Hello, this is my first machine learning project submitted,
it is a mobile price classification and the dataset is from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification. 
I put train dataset which is labeled, and test dataset which isn't labeled, 
Sarah.h5 which is my model and PriceRange.ipynb which is my code.
